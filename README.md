# SchedScope 🧠⚙️

A Linux kernel scheduler experimentation framework running inside QEMU.

The goal was to go beyond reading about CFS — to instrument it, modify it, measure the effect, and understand the trade-offs from inside the kernel.

## 🧠 Part of a Two-Project Scheduler Study

This project is one half of a connected study on CPU scheduling:

| | SchedScope | Mini Scheduler |
|---|---|---|
| Level | Linux kernel (fair.c) | Userspace C simulator |
| Environment | QEMU + custom kernel | Single binary, no dependencies |
| Iteration speed | Minutes per rebuild | Milliseconds |
| Noise | Real hardware, real OS | Deterministic ticks |
| Purpose | Prove concepts on real hardware | Isolate and validate policy logic |

Both projects share the same trace format, the same metric definitions, and the same scheduling concepts.
The userspace simulator was built to iterate on policy ideas fast. SchedScope proves they hold under real kernel conditions.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- Boots a custom-built Linux 6.6 kernel inside QEMU
- Instruments `pick_next_task_fair()` with structured `[SCHED_TRACE]` events
- Runs controlled CPU-bound and IO-bound workloads via config files
- Collects, normalizes, and analyzes scheduling traces
- Compares baseline CFS against a modified vruntime placement policy
- Generates metrics and plots per run

---

## 🧪 The Modification

**File:** `linux/kernel/sched/fair.c`

```c
se->vruntime += nice * 50000;
```

Applied at task enqueue. The effect:

- Tasks with lower nice values (higher priority) get a smaller vruntime → selected earlier by the red-black tree
- Tasks with higher nice values (lower priority) get a larger vruntime → pushed back in the run queue

This biases placement at enqueue time, making priority re-enter competition earlier without touching the core CFS pick logic.

## 📊 Measured Results

| Metric | Baseline | Modified |
|---|---|---|
| Context switches | 13,478 | 22,164 |
| Preemptions | 6,777 | 11,217 |
| Trace duration (ns) | 7,179,319,944 | 6,626,954,468 |
| Fairness index | 0.2399 | 0.2184 |

**Observation:** The modified scheduler showed +64% context switches and +66% preemptions, with a slight drop in the fairness index. The shorter trace duration suggests faster task turnover. These results come from a small number of runs and are presented as initial observations, not final claims.

**Trade-off:** Increased scheduling activity improves responsiveness for high-priority tasks but adds overhead and reduces fairness across the board.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Build kernel → Boot in QEMU → Run workloads → Collect traces
     ↓
Filter [SCHED_TRACE] events → Normalize → Compute metrics
     ↓
CSV export → Plot generation → Baseline vs Modified comparison
```

## ⚙️ Key components:

- `linux/kernel/sched/fair.c` — instrumented and modified scheduler
- `workloads/` — C programs for CPU-bound and IO-bound behavior
- `scripts/collect_trace_run.sh` — boots QEMU and captures trace output
- `scripts/analyze_trace.py` — parses events and computes metrics
- `scripts/benchmark_runner.py` — batch execution across configs
- `scripts/generate_plots.py` — Gantt timeline, latency, fairness plots

## 🛠️ Quick Start

```bash
# Build workloads
bash scripts/build_workloads.sh

# Build initramfs
bash scripts/build_initramfs.sh rootfs rootfs.cpio.gz

# Build kernel
make -C linux -j"$(nproc)" bzImage

# Run one trace collection
bash scripts/collect_trace_run.sh --run-name run_01

# Analyze
python3 scripts/analyze_trace.py results/run_01/sched_trace.log

# Batch benchmark
python3 scripts/benchmark_runner.py --manifest benchmarks/baseline_runs.json

# Generate plots
python3 scripts/generate_plots.py results/run_01 --summary-csv results/summary.csv
```

## 🔧 What I Would Do Differently

- Use custom tracepoints (`TRACE_EVENT`) instead of `trace_printk` — lower overhead and cleaner output
- Add an explicit task completion event to the trace schema to avoid inferred turnaround times
- Run more benchmark iterations to strengthen the statistical validity of the results
- Test the modification under multi-core scheduling to observe per-core queue effects
